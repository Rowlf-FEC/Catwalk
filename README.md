## Overview
Project Catwalk is a complete redesign of our client' retail portal, and is designed to address the outdated interface that has driven customers away. Team Rowlf's intitiative is to modernize and glamourize our client's portal, and to welcome their customers to the future of clothing design. 

## Our Scope
The initial release will focus on providing the MVP for our retail application. Features implemented will be constrained to the client experience which enables customers to search, browse, add to cart, and checkout.
